Subject: Request for Extension on Deliverable Due to VPN Limitations

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a challenge I am currently facing while working on the assigned tasks.

As part of my data science work, certain tasks require access to the internet for research, sourcing data, and validating insights. However, due to the constraints of working within the VPN environment, I do not have internet access, which is critical to efficiently performing the necessary analyses and meeting the quality expectations.

Without internet access, completing the assigned tasks within the tight deadlines is proving to be particularly challenging. I kindly request an extension on the deliverables to allow me the time needed to work effectively under the current circumstances or, alternatively, a workaround for accessing the required resources.

Your understanding and support in resolving this matter will be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are alternative solutions that can help facilitate the completion of the task.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Subject: Challenges in Meeting Deadlines Due to Web Access Restrictions

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some challenges I am encountering while working on the tasks assigned under the current tight deadlines.

The restricted internet access within the VPN environment is significantly impacting my productivity. While the whitelist of websites provided includes platforms like Hugging Face, their usability is limited as key functionalities like copy-paste and certain navigations are blocked. Similarly, access to Stack Overflow and other critical resources for troubleshooting is either partially or completely restricted, making it difficult to find and apply solutions effectively.

In cases where I attempt to follow a resolution link on these platforms, I am often redirected to another page that ends up being blocked. This hinders the problem-solving process and delays the completion of tasks.

I kindly request your guidance on how to proceed under these constraints. If possible, enabling broader access to essential sites or providing alternative solutions would greatly help in ensuring the timely delivery of the project.

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further.
